# 📚 Locus – Offline PDF Search Tool

Locus is a lightweight, offline desktop tool designed to help students and researchers find the exact page that answers their questions within a library of PDFs. By combining BM25 keyword matching with semantic similarity, Locus understands both the exact words you type and the meaning behind your questions.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- **Hybrid Search**  
  Toggle between *Semantic* mode (for conceptual understanding) and *Literal* mode (for exact term matching) using our custom UI slider.

- **Offline Privacy**  
  Your documents never leave your machine—100% local processing with no cloud dependencies.

- **Jump to Page**  
  Double-click any result to open your PDF directly at the relevant page (optimized for [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/)).

- **Hardware Optimized**  
  Choose from four quality profiles (*Fast* to *Best*) to match your PC's RAM and CPU capabilities.
